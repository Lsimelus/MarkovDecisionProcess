A Markov decision process (MDP) is defined as a stochastic decision-making process that uses a mathematical framework to model the decision-making of a dynamic system in scenarios where the results are either random or controlled by a decision maker, which makes sequential decisions over time. This project can be ran with `java SmallGrid DISCOUNT_FACTOR, EPSILON, POS TERMINAL, NEG TERMINAL, NON TERMINAL REWARD`. An example command is 'java SmallGrid 0.99 1e-6 1 -1 -0.04`
